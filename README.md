# CppBuilder-ProcessingAndSortingOfDataFromSingle-frequency receiversSRNS 

<p><strong>Task</strong>:<br />
Create a program in C++ that allows the data received from the receiver from RINEX files in text format to obtain the pseudodality difference (this is the distance between the satellite and the receiver obtained by multiplying the value of the speed of light with the time delay in signal propagation measured by the satellite and receiver clocks) of the satellite and sorts the pseudodalities for each navigation to the satellite to simplify further processing. Here's what the file looks like irkj1380.txt , in which you need to sort the pseudodality for each navigation satellite. We took this data from the base station.<br />
<strong>Task</strong>:<br />
Let's try both for the first and for the second epoch (time: 0:00 - 0:30) to perform such operations. The name of the satellite is displayed, and the distance (range) of the satellite. the first line is for the first epoch, the second line is for the second epoch

<p><strong>Manual</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>The IDE for C/C++ development - Borland Builder must be installed. I recommend installing the IDE in Windows using the following link: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDvVosvyVp0&list=LL&index=315" target="_blank">youtube</a></li>
<li>after installation - run Borland Builder - open the project - in the projects tab, click on launch</li>
